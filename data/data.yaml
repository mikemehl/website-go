        I worked on the firmware for several IoT products for various clients, including 
        utility, air quality, safety, and industrial applications. As a solo firmware engineer 
        on most projects, I worked closely with hardware engineers, web developers, and 
        graphic designers to develop new products and write firmware that meets clients' 
        needs, while keeping a holistic system perspective. This role also featured daily
        client interactions and travel for integration sessions.
      position: Firmware Engineer
      start_date: August 2021
      end_date: Present
      highlights:
        - Utilized Buildroot and Nerves/Elixir in the development of an air quality monitoring
          system for a custom hardware platform utilizing a Quectel cellular modem to connect with AWS.
          This system was used to add connectivity to an existing line of products. Included integration
          with a third party OTA platform.
        - Improved the performance of a bare metal embedded system for a preseed client. The product was
          an IoT utility monitoring system built on an ESP32 based platform, utilizing a LoRa radio.
          After successfully improving their system, the client was able to secure seed funding and
          successfully bring the product to market.
        - Developed test firmware to aid with production line verification of functionality.
        - Aided clients in preparing their products for FCC and UL certification.

        I worked on the embedded software for several large radar systems, with areas of functionality including signal processing, 
        radio control, target tracking, and data transport. As a key engineer on the team, 
        I worked closely with systems engineers to implement new algorithms, perform lab 
        testing, and improve performance.
      position: Embedded Software Engineer
      start_date: July 2017
      end_date: August 2021
      highlights:
        - Architected and implemented a new search and target tracking algorithm in C++. The algorithm involved partitioning of
          the search volume to utilize cutting edge hardware capabilities. Worked closely with systems and integration engineers to
          implement the algorithm, develop host based test systems, optimize for the target platform, and verify functionality
          during integration.
        - Worked with a team to port a legacy radar system new hardware, including updating the software from a VxWorks based system to a
          custom Linux distribution.
        - Developed a testing application for replaying recorded radar data, allowing for rapid development and testing of new algorithms
          from user workstations. This helped several engineers deliver early by allowing them to work independently from the integration lab.

      Math grind. Started as a solo project while I was in college, has evolved into
      a legit band. Can't believe I made it this far already lol.
    discography:
      - album: The Mirror, My Weapon, I Love You
        date: October 27th, 2023
        brief: Angry, reflective, dissonant, and emotional mathgrind.
        description: |
          Recorded at God City in August 2022, our first recording as a full band. 
          We stayed at the studio for the week to finish recording. Probably the 
          single thing I'm most proud of.
      - album: Euclid C Finder!
        date: October 2018
        brief: MySpace love letter mathgrind.
        description: |
          Second EP, recorded ~6 months after the first one at The Monster House in 
          Waldorf, MD. I practiced relentlessly before recording and worked on these 
          songs almost every day for months. I am the only performer on this record.
      - album: A Standard Basis For The Set Of All Discontent
        date: February 2018
        brief: Raw mathgrind, with lots of MySpace and grind/power violence influences.
        description: |
          I originally intended this to just be a demo, but I ended up just releasing it. 
          I was quite surprised with the response. Recorded on a Zoom R8 at my aparment and 
          in my mom's basement. The guitar and bass is the Zoom R8 amp modeller lol.

      This is KTSG but grown up, and with kids.
    discography:
      - album: Demos
        date: 2015
        brief: Kiss The Surf Goodbye
        description: |
          There's actually two releases here, but they're very short so I'm going to lump them together.
          Basically, Kiss The Sky Goodbye reborn, but with less of a focus on outright fury. This band was
          very short lived (as all of my projects with Kyle and Jon were), but was a blast to play in.

      Music nerds I didn't know that well asked me to join there band. Made some awesome friends and had
      a lot of fun. Overall, two thumbs up.
    discography:
      - album: Split with The Head are Zeroes
        date: Winter 2014
        brief: Slowed down Neck First
        description: |
          My first vinyl release! I'm not a fan of how or side came out, but THAZ's side rules.
          The release show for this had us and THAZ play a battle set in a Baltimore row home basement
          with the crowd placed in between the two of us. One of my favorite shows of all time.
      - album: I Can Feel My Skin Crawl
        date: 2012
        brief: Big brain math grind, bring yr calculators
        description: |
          Neck First was a lot of fun to play in. I mostly learned Sean's songs and tried to add more dissonance on top 
          of what was already there. Some of these songs were pretty difficult to learn, but I think
          we eventually figured out that if we just played them a lot, we'd eventually get the hang of it.

      My old breacore project! First time releasing electronic music. Lots of mashcore influences, but not mashcore.
    discography:
      - album: Follow The Yellow Chip Road
        date: 2013
        brief: Chiptunes made in the back of the Neck First van
        description: |
          I brought my DMG-01 and LSDJ with me for one of Neck First's tours, and made these songs
          during the long drives. I love listening to this because it reminds me of all of those fun moments.
      - album: Mherdad
        date: 2013
        brief: A leaner breakcore release, at 250 bpm
        description: |
          I focused a lot on cleaning up my production for this release. For whatever reason, 220bpm
          was starting to sound slow to me, so a lot of these tracks ended up being around 250bpm. When I 
          listen to it now, it sounds kind of ridiculous, but I love it. A lot of these songs I wish I had 
          taken more time on, and was never quite happy with the final product. That said, people seemed to like 
          it. Ultimately, it would be the death knell of my breakcore productions. The chopping on these albums was
          all done manually with lots of resampling, and sitting in front of Renoise for hours to get a bar right
          was exhausting. In the future, whenever I do make electronic music again, I'm going to focus on doing things
          live rather than programming them in.
      - album: Ragcore Anthems Volume I
        date: 2012
        brief: Chopping obsessed breakcore
        description: |
          Ahhh, my first electronic release. The production is muddy. The songs are goofy and a mish mash of moods. Most of
          these songs follow the tried and true Mherdad forumla of rendering synth loops and chopping them together. It 
          was alot of fun, and I miss it sometimes.

      I recorded four songs on my own in a very skramz/metalcore/power violence crossbreed style.
      Just kind of did it, put it on MySpace, and called it a day. Fun fact: the first song on the first
      Euclid C Finder EP is a cover of the first song on Quantico 3mph.

        date: Spring 2009
        brief: A whirlwind of drum shred, noisy guitars, and pissed vocals.
        description: |
          This album haunted me for a long time. I joined this band shortly after they formed and 
          released a little two song demo. It sounded kinda like converge, or like a "southern hardcore"
          band that was in style at the time. Within four months, with a good share of member changes, it
          sounded like the record. Our live shows were purposely violent, and we stuck to or idealistic guns
          whenever we could. That said, this band was not healthy. I still love Jon and the rest of the band,
          but I'm glad that most of us took the time to try to heal from whatever was eating at us.

      Synced delay pedal chill and roll. I started this band just out of high school by myself just 
      recording my delay pedal doodles in my room. It was always a part time band. I think we only ever
      played a single show. Me and Paul eventually tried to put together a full band around it, but it 
      fell apart unfortunately. The newer stuff was rockier.
    discography:
      - album: Demo
        date: Fall 2007

      Fuck yeah mid 2000s metalcore! I joined this band as second guitar and made some awesome friends.
      I have to say, of all of the bands I've ever been in, this was definitely the most fun. Our songs were
      simple and pretty predictable metalcore of the era, and god damn it, we were awesome. People used to 
      actually hardcore dance at our gigs, and it wasn't just a room of pretentious hardcore kids we'd play to.
      We broke up once in the time period I have listed above, but did briefly reform.

        brief: So many demos
        description: |
          I don't think we ever released a proper album, but we did release a bunch of demos. I remember
          the first one was recorded live, with our amps stacked in a way to help with the room sound. It
          was awful, but people still dug it.

      My first grind band. Started as a duo with a fairly straightforward grind sound, added a bassist and second
      guitar later and got slightly mathier. We played two shows, one of which was an absolute disaster (I've never
      had so many people walk out during a set). A foundation for things to come.

      My first band, period. And we played pop punk. Who'd a thunk it? 
      I left the band because I was too anxious to travel to practice one day. Yeah. Glad I'm 
      finally getting all of that sorted out. Love these folks though, we had a lot of fun. Got to
      play the county battle of the bands that year.

          I don't remember much about our songs, except how to play a couple and the weird place we
          recorded at. That guy was strange.
