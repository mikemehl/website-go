      I worked on the firmware for several IoT products for various clients, including 
      utility, air quality, safety, and industrial applications. As a solo firmware engineer 
      on most projects, I worked closely with hardware engineers, web developers, and 
      graphic designers to develop new products and write firmware that meets clients' 
      needs, while keeping a holistic system perspective. This role also featured daily
      client interactions and travel for integration sessions.
    position: Firmware Engineer
    start_date: August 2021
    end_date: Present
    highlights:
      - Utilized Buildroot and Nerves/Elixir in the development of an air quality monitoring
        system for a custom hardware platform utilizing a Quectel cellular modem to connect with AWS.
        This system was used to add connectivity to an existing line of products. Included integration
        with a third party OTA platform.
      - Improved the performance of a bare metal embedded system for a preseed client. The product was
        an IoT utility monitoring system built on an ESP32 based platform, utilizing a LoRa radio.
        After successfully improving their system, the client was able to secure seed funding and
        successfully bring the product to market.
      - Developed test firmware to aid with production line verification of functionality.
      - Aided clients in preparing their products for FCC and UL certification.

      I worked on the embedded software for several large radar systems, with areas of functionality including signal processing, 
      radio control, target tracking, and data transport. As a key engineer on the team, 
      I worked closely with systems engineers to implement new algorithms, perform lab 
      testing, and improve performance.
    position: Embedded Software Engineer
    start_date: July 2017
    end_date: August 2021
    highlights:
      - Architected and implemented a new search and target tracking algorithm in C++. The algorithm involved partitioning of
        the search volume to utilize cutting edge hardware capabilities. Worked closely with systems and integration engineers to
        implement the algorithm, develop host based test systems, optimize for the target platform, and verify functionality
        during integration.
      - Worked with a team to port a legacy radar system new hardware, including updating the software from a VxWorks based system to a
        custom Linux distribution.
      - Developed a testing application for replaying recorded radar data, allowing for rapid development and testing of new algorithms
        from user workstations. This helped several engineers deliver early by allowing them to work independently from the integration lab.
